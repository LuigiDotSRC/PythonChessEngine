TODO:
- Add point tracking for controlling middle board
- Add winconditions (points by end of 20 turns, pawn makes it to opposite side)

NEW IDEA: 
- Remove king, new mode of chess:
    - 20 moves, whoever controls the middle of the board (c4 to f5) the longest wins 
    - If a pawn makes it to the other side of the board, the game is won 
    - No need for King mechanics (check, checkmate, castling, behavior, promotion)
    
BUGS:
- Pawn cannot take diagonally? Extensive testing req. happened when White pawn on c4 could not take black pawn on d5
