# PythonChessEngine
Using Python, I created a 2-player local chess interface which can be played from terminal. 
Instead of traditional chess however, this is a re-invented version where both sides do not have a king. Instead, players
must win by completing one of the two winconditions available to the player:
    - If a Pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, they win 
    - The game lasts 20 moves where each move points are added to the score depending on how many units control the middle spaces (c4-f5). The player with the most points win 

This project was mostly to practice logic for something as intricate as programming the rules for a game of chess. There are no fancy algorithms for this project but there 
is lots of room for improvement in this project like restructuring the code to be better organized, adding more readability and improving on existing search alogirthms to avoid wasting computing resources. Overall, this was a fun project and allowed me to recreate one of my favourite games with Python.
